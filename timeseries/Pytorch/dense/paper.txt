1. Introduction
What to include:
Overview of Kubernetes (K8s) as a container orchestration platform and its importance in modern distributed systems.
The role of Redis as an in-memory store and its common use in stateless architectures.
The limitations of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), particularly in environments with dynamic workloads.
The motivation for exploring a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to improve scalability and resource efficiency.
Brief description of the contributions of your paper: the comparison between HPA, dense RL agents, and LSTM-based RL agents, and the improvements achieved.
2. Background and Related Work
What to include:
Detailed explanation of the HPA and how it functions, emphasizing its limitations (reactive scaling, CPU/memory utilization as the sole metrics).
Overview of Redis and its significance in Kubernetes environments.
Related work on autoscaling techniques in cloud environments, particularly with deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches.
Discussion of similar studies and how your work differs or builds upon existing methods.
3. System Design
What to include:
Architecture of your Kubernetes/Redis setup and the placement of your RL agents within it.
Detailed description of the deep RL agents: one with dense layers and the other with LSTM layers.
Explanation of how the LSTM layers capture temporal patterns in workloads, providing a more intelligent scaling mechanism.
Design of the reward function in your RL agents, which takes into account load, latency, CPU and memory usage, VM count, etc.
Overview of the simulation environment used to test the RL agents.
4. Implementation
What to include:
Details on how the RL agents were trained, including the input features (e.g., Redis requests, CPU, memory usage) and training data.
How the Redis cluster was configured within Kubernetes for testing the autoscaling behavior.
Modifications made to the Kubernetes environment to incorporate the RL agents, and how the HPA was disabled.
Any technical challenges you faced during implementation, such as handling latency, dynamic workloads, or VM penalties.
5. Evaluation
What to include:
Setup for your experiments: hardware, software, and metrics used (load, CPU, memory, etc.).
Comparison between the three methods: HPA, RL with dense layers, and RL with LSTM layers.
Quantitative results demonstrating:
500% improvement in cost efficiency over the HPA.
40% performance improvement of the LSTM-based RL agent over the dense agent.
Visualizations (plots) of key metrics like pod count, latency, and CPU/memory usage over time.
6. Discussion
What to include:
Analysis of the results, including why the RL agents outperform HPA.
Discussion of the trade-offs between dense and LSTM-based RL agents.
Limitations of the current approach, including potential scalability issues or edge cases.
How the modelâ€™s performance might change in other environments or with different workloads.
